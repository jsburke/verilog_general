#Linear Feedback Shift Register

LFSRs are a fun spin on shift registers that normally pick off elements of the existing shift register and XOR them.  They have applications in pseudorandom number generation, but their periods tend to be limited.  However, they're still a quick fun studypiece.

In the verilog here, you can modify the bahavior by selecting different bits to XOR.  I'll upload an example of the circuit here later and hopefully the math behind them.  That will be in this README.

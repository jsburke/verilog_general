#verilog_general

This repository is mainly meant as a place to for small verilog examples and practice. I only will update items if there are glaring errors.

There will only be smaller things in here like counters, adders, memory related snippites, maybe an ALU. Nothing big.

Everything here can be used or modified for other projects as needed.

As time goes on I hope to add readmes to most of the small items in here explaining what each is and how they work.
In addition, some of the more interesting ones might get state diagrams or animaions, with basic schematics or the like.

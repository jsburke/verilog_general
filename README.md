#verilog_general

This repository is mainly meant as a place to for small verilog examples and practice. I only will update items if there are glaring errors.

There will only be smaller things in here like counters, adders, memory related snippites, maybe an ALU. Nothing big.

Everything here can be used or modified for other projects as needed.
